			 For Developers

 PHP Navigator is written in PHP and JavaScript (including AJAX).
This is very tiny compared to other file manager. (roFileWalker is 64Kb)
Here is some useful information for developers.

Files
=====
1. windows.php: It is the script that handles requests and decide which action to
   perform based on the request. It also calls the functions for authenticating, client
   browser features detection (AJAX, Resolution etc).

2. explorer.php: contains the core function explore, which lists the files/folders in 
   the current directory.

3. functions.php: contains a lot of cool functions like upload, filestatus,
   authenticate, fileicon (now groupicon), download etc.

4. Action files: actions like recursive delete, new folder, extract etc. (now recursive copy and move)

5. JavaScripts: In AJAX mode, files 'windows.js' and 'ajax.js' are loaded, while
   in normal mode, 'windows.js' and 'normal.js' are loaded. (fixed for Linux Opera v9.2)

6. It use 'zip.lib.php' for zipping and 'pclzip.class.php' (v1.2) for unzipping.

7. The file 'thumb.php' is (now NOT) in the images directory handles thumbnail of images. You can 
   refer this file as:
   <img src="thumb.php?img=someimgfile">
   <img src="thumb.php?size=150&img=someimgfile">
   <img src="thumb.php?x=64&y=60&img=someimgfile">

8. If you are serious about using this version of PHP Navigator to develop your own extensions, 
   I seriously advise you to take a look at v5, which is re-designed in a modular way with the 
   idea of supporting custom extensions, or modules for PHP Navigator. As a result it is also 
   heavily documented to support both extensions and new developments. (Breifly it contains 
   modular skins, for easy extension, copes with new development "base" pages as modules in the 
   "File and Folder tasks" list, allows custom "functions" to replace existing ones in both 
   PHP and JS, and has a "virtual drive" infra-structure to support access to other filesystems, 
   including FTP, GMAIL, MySQL and custom MySQL, ie Users. It can also hide certain files and 
   folders from "plain" user access, this is from roFileWalker. It also supports variable size 
   file and button icons, custom skin compilation, altenate "panels", layouts and context menus)
